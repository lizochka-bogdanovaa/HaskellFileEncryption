Alexander Mikhailovich Lyapunov (May 6 (May 25) 1857, Russian Empire - November 3 (November 16) 1918, Odessa, Russian Soviet Republic) was an outstanding Russian mathematician and mechanic. He was a corresponding member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences since 1901. Alexander Mikhailovich was the brother of Boris Mikhailovich Lyapunov and Sergei Mikhailovich Lyapunov, a student of Paphnutiy Lvovich Chebyshev. In 1880, he graduated from St. Petersburg University and from 1885 taught at Kharkov University (he became a professor in 1893). Since 1902, he worked at the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. One of Lyapunov's key achievements was the development of the theory of stability of equilibrium and motion of mechanical systems, which are determined by a finite number of parameters. The essence of this mathematical theory is to study the behavior of solutions of systems of ordinary differential equations when the independent variable tends to infinity. His work on the theory of motion stability is an important scientific foundation for various automatic devices, including flight control systems for aircraft and missiles. In the field of probability theory, Lyapunov proposed a new research method known as the method of "characteristic functions", which is distinguished by its generality and effectiveness.
